# Overview
- Out-of-school suspensions- Current Year - % of students with OOS suspensions
- Can model based on suspension if we transform it into a booean (yes/no for high suspensions). High suspension is defined as > median

```{r}
summary(dc$suspensions)
```

```{r}
ggplot(dc) + geom_histogram(aes(x=suspensions))
```

```{r}
ggplot(dc) + geom_point(aes(x=suspensions,y=(ela_proficiency)))
```

```{r}
ggplot(dc) + geom_boxplot(aes(x=high_suspensions, y=math_proficiency))
```

```{r}
fit <- lm(data=dc, math_proficiency ~ high_suspensions)
summary(fit)
dc <- dc %>% add_residuals(fit)
ggplot(dc) + geom_point(aes(x=high_suspensions, y=resid))

```

Residuals don't look especially normal, but there's clearly an influence
